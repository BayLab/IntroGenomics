# Week 2- Working with files
We will be following some of the data carpentry tutorial (Copyright 2016 @ Software Carpentry) "Introduction to the command line for genomics". We have made some modifications to the data carpentry tutorial to fit our course. 

## Questions to Answer:

+ What are some navigational shortcuts I can use to make my work more efficient?

+ How can I perform operations on files outside of my working directory?

+ How can I work with hidden directories and hidden files?

+ How can I view and search file contents?

+ How can I create, copy and delete files and directories?

+ How can I control who has permission to modify a file?

+ How can I repeat recently used commands?

## Navigational shortcuts

The root directory is the highest level directory in your file system and contains files that are important for your computer to perform its daily work. While you will be using the root (/) at the beginning of your absolute paths, it is important that you avoid working with data in these higher-level directories, as your commands can permanently alter files that the operating system needs to function. In many cases, trying to run commands in root directories will require special permissions which will be discussed later, so it’s best to avoid them and work within your home directory. Dealing with the home directory is very common. The tilde character, ~, is a shortcut for your home directory. In our case, the root directory is two levels above our home directory, so cd or cd ~ will take you to `/home/margeno` and cd `/` will take you to `/`. 

Navigate to your home directory if you aren't there already and enter the command:
```html
$ cd 
$ ls ~

Desktop    Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh  Public	  get-pip.py  miniconda.sh
Documents  Music		       Templates  mambaforge  ondemand
Downloads  Pictures		       Videos	  miniconda

```

This prints the contents of your home directory, without you needing to type the full path.

The commands `cd`, and `cd ~` are very useful for quickly navigating back to your home directory. We will be using the ~ character in later lessons to specify our home directory.


We can make the ls output more comprehensible by using the flag -F, which tells ls to add a trailing / to the names of directories. First make sure you are in the eve198-genomics directory by printing your working directory
```html
$ cd /group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics
$ pwd
```
```html
/group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics
```
Then type ls -F. It should show your and all your classmates' directories. 

```html
$ ls -F
```
```html
mlarmstrong/
```

Anything with a “/” after it is a directory. Things with a “*” after them are programs. If there are no decorations, it’s a file.

`ls` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type

```html
$ man ls
```

`man` (short for manual) displays detailed documentation (also referred as man page or man file) for `bash` commands. It is a powerful resource to explore bash commands, understand their usage and flags. Some manual files are very long. You can scroll through the file using your keyboard’s down arrow or use the Space key to go forward one page and the `b` key to go backwards one page. When you are done reading, hit `q` to quit.

Use the `-l` option for the `ls` command to display more information for each item in the directory. What is one piece of additional information this long format gives you that you don’t see with the bare `ls` command?

```html
$ ls -l
```

No one can possibly learn all of these arguments, that’s what the manual page is for. You can (and should) refer to the manual page or other help files as needed.


Let's navigate to our individual folders and make a directory for class this week named `week2'
```html
$ cd `yourdirectory`
$ ls
```
Now let's download some data to work with! 

There are two main ways to do this. We can use the command `wget` which needs a link to the file that we want to download. If there's a file saved on a website somewhere (anywhere on the internet) `wget` will download it for you. If our data file is on github, which is where most of our data will be stored, we'll use the command `git-clone` In this example we're going to download all the material in our individual directory
```html
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlarmstrong/IntroGenomics_Data/week2.tar.gz

# use the tar command to uncompress the file. This will also automatically make a week2 directory in your directory

tar -xzvf week2.tar.gz
```

Now that we have something in our directory we can use the `ls` command a bit more.

...

Let’s go into the week2 directory and see what is in there.

```html
$ cd week2
$ ls -F
```

```html
SRR6805880_1.fastq SRR6805880_2.fastq
```

This directory contains two files with .fastq extensions. FASTQ is a format for storing information about sequencing reads and their quality. We will be learning more about FASTQ files in a later lesson.


From this output, we can see that `..` did indeed take us back one level in our file system.

You can chain these together like so:

```html
$ ls ../../
```
prints the contents of `/home`.

Let's explore a few more properties of the `ls` function

Go back to your directory.

```html
$ cd ..
```

Let's look at some of the options for the `ls` function using the `man` command (note this will print out several lines of text)

```html
$ man ls
```
The `-a` option is short for all and says that it causes `ls` to “not ignore entries starting with .” This is the option we want.

```html
$ ls -a

```
You'll see there are many more files shown now that we can look at the hidden ones. 

In most commands the flags can be combined together in no particular order to obtain the desired results/output.

```html
$ ls -Fa
$ ls -laF
```

## Examining the contents of other directories

By default, the `ls` commands lists the contents of the working directory (i.e. the directory you are in). You can always find the directory you are in using the `pwd` command. However, you can also give `ls` the names of other directories to view. Navigate to your directory if you are not already there.

```html
$ cd /group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics/
```

Then enter the command:

```html
$ ls 'yourdirectory'

data
```

This will list the contents of the your directory without you needing to navigate there.



```

## Key Points
+ The /, ~, and .. characters represent important navigational shortcuts.

+ Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a -.

+ You can view file contents using `less`, `cat`, `head` or `tail`.

+ The commands `cp`, `mv`, and `mkdir` are useful for manipulating existing files and creating new directories.

+ You can view file permissions using `ls -l` and change permissions using `chmod`.

+ The `history` command and the up arrow on your keyboard can be used to repeat recently used commands.
