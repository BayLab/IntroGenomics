# Week 2- Working with Files
We will be following some of the data carpentry tutorial again (Copyright 2016 @ Software Carpentry) "Introduction to the command line for genomics". We have made some modifications to the data carpentry tutorial to fit our course. 

## Main Objectives:
- Learn how to use navigational shortcuts and repeat recently used commands to make coding more efficient
- Learn how to view and work with hidden directories and hidden files
- Learn how to view and search file contents

## Navigational shortcuts

The root directory is the highest level directory in your file system and contains files that are important for your computer to perform its daily work. While you will be using the root (/) at the beginning of your absolute paths, it is important that you avoid working with data in these higher-level directories, as your commands can permanently alter files that the operating system needs to function. In many cases, trying to run commands in root directories will require special permissions which will be discussed later, so it’s best to avoid them and work within your home directory. Dealing with the home directory is very common. The tilde character, ~, is a shortcut for your home directory. In our case, the root directory is '/group' 

We can make the ls output more comprehensible by using the flag -F, which tells ls to add a trailing / to the names of directories. First make sure you are in the eve198-genomics directory by printing your working directory
```html
$ cd /group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics
$ pwd
```
```html
/group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics
```
Then type ls -F. It should show your and all your classmates' directories. 

```html
$ ls -F
```
```html
mlarmstrong/
```

Anything with a “/” after it is a directory. Things with a “*” after them are programs. If there are no decorations, it’s a file.

Use the `-l` option for the `ls` command to display more information for each item in the directory. What is one piece of additional information this long format gives you that you don’t see with the bare `ls` command?

```html
$ ls -l
```

No one can possibly learn all of these arguments, that’s what the manual page is for. You can (and should) refer to the manual page `man` or other help files as needed.


Let's navigate to our individual folders: 
```html
$ cd `yourdirectory`
$ ls
```

Another navigational shortcut that can be really helpful is just hitting the up arrow on your keyboard. This pulls up the line of code that you ran recently! You can keep hitting the up arrow until you get to a line you want. This can help you save time since you won't need to retype long lines of code over and over again.


Now let's download some data to work with! 

## Details on the FASTQ format
A fastq file is a text file with information on the quality of the sequence data

Although it looks complicated (and it is), it's easy to understand the
[fastq](https://knowledge.illumina.com/software/general/software-general-reference_material-list/000002211) format with a little decoding. Some rules about the format
include...

|Line|Description|
|----|-----------|
|1|Always begins with '@' and then information about the read|
|2|The actual DNA sequence|
|3|Always begins with a '+' and sometimes the same info in line 1|
|4|Has a string of characters which represent the quality (phred) scores; must have same number of characters as line 2|


## Our data set: FASTQ files
We can use the command `wget` which needs a link to the file that we want to download. If there's a file saved on a website somewhere (anywhere on the internet) `wget` will download it for you. If our data file is on github, which is where most of our data will be stored, we'll use the command `git-clone` 

In this example we're going to download all the material in our individual directory. Navigate there and then type the following command:

```html
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlarmstrong/IntroGenomics_Data/main/week2.tar.gz
```
Use the tar command to uncompress the file. This will also automatically make a week2 directory in your individual directory:

```html
tar -xzvf week2.tar.gz
```
Check out what is in this directory with the ls command. Remember you can do `ls -l` to see more information on the contents

```html
untrimmed_fastq sra_metadata TableS2_QTL_Bay_2017.txt
```
Now that we know how to navigate around our directory structure, let's start working with our sequencing files. We did a sequencing experiment and  have two results files, which are stored in our `untrimmed_fastq` directory. 

## Wildcards

Navigate to your `untrimmed_fastq` directory in your week2 individual directory


```html
$ cd ~/group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics/yourdirectory/week2/untrimmed_fastq
```


We are interested in looking at the FASTQ files in this directory. We can list
all files with the .fastq extension using the command:

```html
$ ls *.fastq
```


```html
SRR097977.fastq  SRR098026.fastq
```


The `*` character is a special type of character called a wildcard, which can be used to represent any number of any type of character. 
Thus, `*.fastq` matches every file that ends with `.fastq`. 

This command: 

```html
$ ls *977.fastq
```


```html
SRR097977.fastq
```


lists only the file that ends with `977.fastq`.

This command:

```html
$ ls /usr/bin/*.sh
```


```html
/usr/bin/gettext.sh  /usr/bin/rescan-scsi-bus.sh
```

Lists every file in `/usr/bin` that ends in the characters `.sh`.
Note that the output displays __full__ paths to files, since
each result starts with `/`.

This directory contains two files with .fastq extensions. FASTQ is a format for storing information about sequencing reads and their quality. We will be learning more about FASTQ files in a later lesson.

`echo` is a built-in shell command that writes its arguments, like a line of text to standard output. 
The `echo` command can also be used with pattern matching characters, such as wildcard characters. 
Here we will use the `echo` command to see how the wildcard character is interpreted by the shell.

 ```html
 $ echo *.fastq
```
 ```html
 SRR097977.fastq SRR098026.fastq
 ```
 

The `*` is expanded to include any file that ends with `.fastq`. We can see that the output of
`echo *.fastq` is the same as that of `ls *.fastq`.

What would the output look like if the wildcard could *not* be matched? Compare the outputs of
`echo *.missing` and `ls *.missing`.

 ```html
$ echo *.missing
 ```

```html
*.missing
```

```html
$ ls *.missing
```

```html
ls: cannot access '*.missing': No such file or directory
```

> ## Class Exercise 1
> Do each of the following tasks from your current directory using a single
> `ls` command for each:
> 
> 1.  List all of the files in `/usr/bin` that start with the letter 'c'.

> 3.  List all of the files in `/usr/bin` that end with the letter 'o'.
>
> Bonus: List all of the files in `/usr/bin` that contain the letter 'a' or the
> letter 'c'.
> 
> Hint: The bonus question requires a Unix wildcard that we haven't talked about
> yet. Try searching the internet for information about Unix wildcards to find
> what you need to solve the bonus problem.
> 

## Command History

If you want to repeat a command that you've run recently, you can access previous
commands using the up arrow on your keyboard to go back to the most recent
command. Likewise, the down arrow takes you forward in the command history.

A few more useful shortcuts: 

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> will cancel the command you are writing, and give you a 
fresh prompt.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> will do a reverse-search through your command history.  This
is very useful.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> or the `clear` command will clear your screen.

You can also review your recent commands with the `history` command, by entering:

```html
$ history
```


to see a numbered list of recent commands. You can reuse one of these commands
directly by referring to the number of that command.

For example, if your history looked like this:

```html
259  ls *
260  ls /usr/bin/*.sh
261  ls *R1*fastq
```


then you could repeat command #260 by entering:

```html
$ !260
```


Type `!` (exclamation point) and then the number of the command from your history.
You will be glad you learned this when you need to re-run very complicated commands.
For more information on advanced usage of `history`, read section 9.3 of
[Bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html).


## Examining Files

We now know how to switch directories, run programs, and look at the
contents of directories, but how do we look at the contents of files?

One way to examine a file is to print out all of the
contents using the program `cat`. 

Enter the following command from within the `untrimmed_fastq` directory: 

```html
$ cat SRR098026.fastq
```


This will print out all of the contents of the `SRR098026.fastq` to the screen.


> ## Class Exercise 2
> 
> 1. Print out the contents of the `~/group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics/'yourdirectory'/Week2/untrimmed_fastq/SRR097977.fastq` file. What is the last line of the file? 
> 2.  From your home directory, and without changing directories,
> use one short command to print the contents of all of the files in
> the `group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics/yourdirectory/week2/untrimmed_fastq` directory.
> 



`cat` is a terrific program, but when the file is really big, it can
be annoying to use. The program, `less`, is useful for this
case. `less` opens the file as read only, and lets you navigate through it. The navigation commands
are identical to the `man` program.

Enter the following command:

```html
$ less SRR097977.fastq
```


Some navigation commands in `less`:

| key     | action |
| ------- | ---------- |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | to go forward |
|  <kbd>b</kbd>    | to go backward |
|  <kbd>g</kbd>    | to go to the beginning |
|  <kbd>G</kbd>    | to go to the end |
|  <kbd>q</kbd>    | to quit |

`less` also gives you a way of searching through files. Use the
"/" key to begin a search. Enter the word you would like
to search for and press `enter`. The screen will jump to the next location where
that word is found. 

**Shortcut:** If you hit "/" then "enter", `less` will  repeat
the previous search. `less` searches from the current location and
works its way forward. Scroll up a couple lines on your terminal to verify
you are at the beginning of the file. Note, if you are at the end of the file and search
for the sequence "CAA", `less` will not find it. You either need to go to the
beginning of the file (by typing `g`) and search again using `/` or you
can use `?` to search backwards in the same way you used `/` previously.

For instance, let's search forward for the sequence `TTTTT` in our file. 
You can see that we go right to that sequence, what it looks like,
and where it is in the file. If you continue to type `/` and hit return, you will move 
forward to the next instance of this sequence motif. If you instead type `?` and hit 
return, you will search backwards and move up the file to previous examples of this motif.

> ## Class Exercise 3
>
> What are the next three nucleotides (characters) after the first instance of the sequence quoted above?
> 


Remember, the `man` program actually uses `less` internally and
therefore uses the same commands, so you can search documentation
using "/" as well!

There's another way that we can look at files, and in this case, just
look at part of them. This can be particularly useful if we just want
to see the beginning or end of the file, or see how it's formatted.

The commands are `head` and `tail` and they let you look at
the beginning and end of a file, respectively.

```html
$ head SRR098026.fastq
```

```


The `-n` option to either of these commands can be used to print the
first or last `n` lines of a file. 

```html
$ head -n 1 SRR098026.fastq
```


```html
@SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
```


```html
$ tail -n 1 SRR098026.fastq
```


```html
A!@B!BBB@ABAB#########!!!!!!!######
```

We can view the first complete read in one of the files in our dataset by using `head` to look at
the first four lines.

```html
$ head -n 4 SRR098026.fastq
```


```html
@SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```


All but one of the nucleotides in this read are unknown (`N`). This is a pretty bad read!

Line 4 shows the quality for each nucleotide in the read. Quality is interpreted as the 
probability of an incorrect base call (e.g. 1 in 10) or, equivalently, the base call 
accuracy (e.g. 90%). To make it possible to line up each individual nucleotide with its quality
score, the numerical score is converted into a code where each individual character 
represents the numerical quality score for an individual nucleotide. For example, in the line
above, the quality score line is: 

```html
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```


The `#` character and each of the `!` characters represent the encoded quality for an 
individual nucleotide. The numerical value assigned to each of these characters depends on the 
sequencing platform that generated the reads. The sequencing machine used to generate our data 
uses the standard Sanger quality PHRED score encoding, Illumina version 1.8 onwards.

Here is a link showing what those different symbols mean for quality scores:  https://help.basespace.illumina.com/files-used-by-basespace/quality-scores

Each character is assigned a quality score between 0 and 42 as shown in the chart below.


```html
Quality encoding: !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJK
                  |         |         |         |         |
Quality score:    0........10........20........30........40..                          
```


Each quality score represents the probability that the corresponding nucleotide call is
incorrect. This quality score is logarithmically based, so a quality score of 10 reflects a
base call accuracy of 90%, but a quality score of 20 reflects a base call accuracy of 99%. 
These probability values are the results from the base calling algorithm and dependent on how 
much signal was captured for the base incorporation. 

Looking back at our read: 

```html
@SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
+SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```


we can now see that the quality of each of the `N`s is 0 and the quality of the only
nucleotide call (`C`) is also very poor (`#` = a quality score of 2). This is indeed a very
bad read. 

## Group Work Activity- Examining a Fastq File
Navigate to eve198-genomics and copy the 'CCGPMC004_M0D060025C_S150_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz' file in the week2_activity directory to your individual directory. 

Next you will need to unzip the fastq file. To do this we will use the command "gunzip". This unzips a gzipped file. "gzip" zips a file again. It will take a second since this is a larger file than our previous examples. It is actually an urchin sample from a recent genomics project Rachael and I worked on! 

```html
gunzip CCGPMC004_M0D060025C_S150_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz
```

Then answer the following questions and submit them to the "Week 2: Examining Files" assignment on canvas. I would not recommend using 'less' or 'cat' on this file due to its size.

1. Write out the first two lines of CCGPMC004_M0D060025C_S150_L003_R1_001.fastq 
2. Remember that line 4 in a fastq file shows the quality (phred) scores. If you look at line 4 and reference the score table from the link and figures below. What is the most common symbol, Q-score and error probability for most of our nucleotide calls?

https://help.basespace.illumina.com/files-used-by-basespace/quality-scores

## Key Points
+ The /, ~, and .. characters represent important navigational shortcuts.

+ The `history` command and the up arrow on your keyboard can be used to repeat recently used commands.

+ You can view file contents using `less`, `cat`, `head` or `tail`.
