One way to examine a file is to print out all of the contents using the program cat. Enter the following command from within the untrimmed_fastq directory: $ cat SRR098026.fastq This will print out all of the contents of the SRR098026.fastq to the screen. Exercise Print out the contents of the ~/data_week2/Week2/data_week2/untrimmed_fastq/SRR097977.fastq file. What is the last line of the file? From your home directory, and without changing directories, use one short command to print the contents of all of the files in the ./data_week2/Week2/data_week2/untrimmed_fastq directory. Solution Solution The last line of the file is C:CCC::CCCCCCCC&lt;8?6A:C28C&lt;608'&amp;&amp;&amp;,'$. cat ./data_week2/Week2/data_week2/untrimmed_fastq/*   cat is a terrific program, but when the file is really big, it can be annoying to use. The program, less, is useful for this case. less opens the file as read only, and lets you navigate through it. The navigation commands are identical to the man program. Enter the following command: $ less SRR097977.fastq Some navigation commands in less: key action Space to go forward b to go backward g to go to the beginning G to go to the end q to quit less also gives you a way of searching through files. Use the “/” key to begin a search. Enter the word you would like to search for and press enter. The screen will jump to the next location where that word is found. Shortcut: If you hit “/” then “enter”, less will repeat the previous search. less searches from the current location and works its way forward. Scroll up a couple lines on your terminal to verify you are at the beginning of the file. Note, if you are at the end of the file and search for the sequence “CAA”, less will not find it. You either need to go to the beginning of the file (by typing g) and search again using / or you can use ? to search backwards in the same way you used / previously. For instance, let’s search forward for the sequence TTTTT in our file. You can see that we go right to that sequence, what it looks like, and where it is in the file. If you continue to type / and hit return, you will move forward to the next instance of this sequence motif. If you instead type ? and hit return, you will search backwards and move up the file to previous examples of this motif. Exercise What are the next three nucleotides (characters) after the first instance of the sequence quoted above? Solution Solution CAC   Remember, the man program actually uses less internally and therefore uses the same commands, so you can search documentation using “/” as well! There’s another way that we can look at files, and in this case, just look at part of them. This can be particularly useful if we just want to see the beginning or end of the file, or see how it’s formatted. The commands are head and tail and they let you look at the beginning and end of a file, respectively. $ head SRR098026.fastq @SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN +SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @SRR098026.2 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:312 length=35 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN +SRR098026.2 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:312 length=35 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @SRR098026.3 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:570 length=35 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN $ tail SRR098026.fastq +SRR098026.247 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:2:1311 length=35 #!##!#################!!!!!!!###### @SRR098026.248 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:2:118 length=35 GNTGNGGTCATCATACGCGCCCNNNNNNNGGCATG +SRR098026.248 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:2:118 length=35 B!;?!A=5922:##########!!!!!!!###### @SRR098026.249 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:2:1057 length=35 CNCTNTATGCGTACGGCAGTGANNNNNNNGGAGAT +SRR098026.249 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:2:1057 length=35 A!@B!BBB@ABAB#########!!!!!!!###### The -n option to either of these commands can be used to print the first or last n lines of a file. $ head -n 1 SRR098026.fastq @SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35 $ tail -n 1 SRR098026.fastq A!@B!BBB@ABAB#########!!!!!!!###### 4.1 Details on the FASTQ format Although it looks complicated (and it is), it’s easy to understand the fastq format with a little decoding. Some rules about the format include… Line Description 1 Always begins with ‘@’ and then information about the read 2 The actual DNA sequence 3 Always begins with a ‘+’ and sometimes the same info in line 1 4 Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores; must have same number of characters as line 2 We can view the first complete read in one of the files in our dataset by using head to look at the first four lines. $ head -n 4 SRR098026.fastq @SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN +SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All but one of the nucleotides in this read are unknown (N). This is a pretty bad read! Line 4 shows the quality for each nucleotide in the read. Quality is interpreted as the probability of an incorrect base call (e.g. 1 in 10) or, equivalently, the base call accuracy (e.g. 90%). To make it possible to line up each individual nucleotide with its quality score, the numerical score is converted into a code where each individual character represents the numerical quality score for an individual nucleotide. For example, in the line above, the quality score line is: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The # character and each of the ! characters represent the encoded quality for an individual nucleotide. The numerical value assigned to each of these characters depends on the sequencing platform that generated the reads. The sequencing machine used to generate our data uses the standard Sanger quality PHRED score encoding, Illumina version 1.8 onwards. Here is a link showing what those different symbols mean for quality scores: https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_OLH_009008/Content/Source/Informatics/BS/QualityScoreEncoding_swBS.htm Each character is assigned a quality score between 0 and 42 as shown in the chart below. Quality encoding: !&quot;#$%&amp;&#39;()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABCDEFGHIJK | | | | | Quality score: 0........10........20........30........40.. Each quality score represents the probability that the corresponding nucleotide call is incorrect. This quality score is logarithmically based, so a quality score of 10 reflects a base call accuracy of 90%, but a quality score of 20 reflects a base call accuracy of 99%. These probability values are the results from the base calling algorithm and dependent on how much signal was captured for the base incorporation. Looking back at our read: @SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN +SRR098026.1 HWUSI-EAS1599_1:2:1:0:968 length=35 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we can now see that the quality of each of the Ns is 0 and the quality of the only nucleotide call (C) is also very poor (# = a quality score of 2). This is indeed a very bad read. 4.2 Creating, moving, copying, and removing Now we can move around in the file structure, look at files, and search files. But what if we want to copy files or move them around or get rid of them? Most of the time, you can do these sorts of file manipulations without the command line, but there will be some cases (like when you’re working with a remote computer like we are for this lesson) where it will be impossible. You’ll also find that you may be working with hundreds of files and want to do similar manipulations to all of those files. In cases like this, it’s much faster to do these operations at the command line. 4.2.1 Copying Files When working with computational data, it’s important to keep a safe copy of that data that can’t be accidentally overwritten or deleted. For this lesson, our raw data is our FASTQ files. We don’t want to accidentally change the original files, so we’ll make a copy of them and change the file permissions so that we can read from, but not write to, the files. First, let’s make a copy of one of our FASTQ files using the cp command. Navigate to the ~/data_week2/Week2/data_week2/untrimmed_fastq directory and enter: $ cp SRR098026.fastq SRR098026-copy.fastq $ ls -F SRR097977.fastq SRR098026-copy.fastq SRR098026.fastq We now have two copies of the SRR098026.fastq file, one of them named SRR098026-copy.fastq. We’ll move this file to a new directory called backup where we’ll store our backup data files. 4.2.2 Creating Directories The mkdir command is used to make a directory. Enter mkdir followed by a space, then the directory name you want to create: $ mkdir backup 4.2.3 Moving / Renaming We can now move our backup file to this directory. We can move files around using the command mv: $ mv SRR098026-copy.fastq backup $ ls backup SRR098026-copy.fastq The mv command is also how you rename files. Let’s rename this file to make it clear that this is a backup: $ cd backup $ mv SRR098026-copy.fastq SRR098026-backup.fastq $ ls SRR098026-backup.fastq 4.2.4 File Permissions We’ve now made a backup copy of our file, but just because we have two copies, it doesn’t make us safe. We can still accidentally delete or overwrite both copies. To make sure we can’t accidentally mess up this backup file, we’re going to change the permissions on the file so that we’re only allowed to read (i.e. view) the file, not write to it (i.e. make new changes). View the current permissions on a file using the -l (long) flag for the ls command: $ ls -l -rw-rw-r-- 1 margeno margeno 43K Apr 6 12:15 SRR098026-backup.fastq The first part of the output for the -l flag gives you information about the file’s current permissions. There are ten slots in the permissions list. The first character in this list is related to file type, not permissions, so we’ll ignore it for now. The next three characters relate to the permissions that the file owner has, the next three relate to the permissions for group members, and the final three characters specify what other users outside of your group can do with the file. We’re going to concentrate on the three positions that deal with your permissions (as the file owner).
