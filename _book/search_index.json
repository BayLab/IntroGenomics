We have made some modifications to the data carpentry tutorial to fit our course. 3.1 Questions to Answer: What are some navigational shortcuts I can use to make my work more efficient? How can I perform operations on files outside of my working directory? How can I work with hidden directories and hidden files? 3.2 Navigational shortcuts The root directory is the highest level directory in your file system and contains files that are important for your computer to perform its daily work. While you will be using the root (/) at the beginning of your absolute paths, it is important that you avoid working with data in these higher-level directories, as your commands can permanently alter files that the operating system needs to function. In many cases, trying to run commands in root directories will require special permissions which will be discussed later, so it’s best to avoid them and work within your home directory. Dealing with the home directory is very common. The tilde character, ~, is a shortcut for your home directory. In our case, the root directory is two levels above our home directory, so cd or cd ~ will take you to /home/margeno and cd / will take you to /. Navigate to your home directory if you aren’t there already and enter the command: $ cd $ ls ~ Desktop Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh Public get-pip.py miniconda.sh Documents Music Templates mambaforge ondemand Downloads Pictures Videos miniconda This prints the contents of your home directory, without you needing to type the full path. The commands cd, and cd ~ are very useful for quickly navigating back to your home directory. We will be using the ~ character in later lessons to specify our home directory. We can make the ls output more comprehensible by using the flag -F, which tells ls to add a trailing / to the names of directories. First make sure you are in the eve198-genomics directory by printing your working directory $ cd /group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics $ pwd /group/rbaygrp/eve198-genomics Then type ls -F. It should show your and all your classmates’ directories. $ ls -F mlarmstrong/ Anything with a “/” after it is a directory. Things with a “*” after them are programs. If there are no decorations, it’s a file. ls has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type $ man ls man (short for manual) displays detailed documentation (also referred as man page or man file) for bash commands. It is a powerful resource to explore bash commands, understand their usage and flags. Some manual files are very long. You can scroll through the file using your keyboard’s down arrow or use the Space key to go forward one page and the b key to go backwards one page. When you are done reading, hit q to quit. Use the -l option for the ls command to display more information for each item in the directory. What is one piece of additional information this long format gives you that you don’t see with the bare ls command? $ ls -l No one can possibly learn all of these arguments, that’s what the manual page is for. You can (and should) refer to the manual page or other help files as needed. Let’s navigate to our individual folders and make a directory for class this week named week2' ```html $ cdyourdirectory` $ mkdir week2 $ ls Now let&#39;s download some data to work with! There are two main ways to do this. We can use the command `wget` which needs a link to the file that we want to download. If theres a file saved on a website somewhere (anywhere on the internet) `wget` will download it for you. If our data file is on github, which is where most of our data will be stored, we&#39;ll use the command `git-clone` In this example we&#39;re going to download all the material in the MarineGenomicsData folder and save it in a folder called data. ```html $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BayLab/MarineGenomicsData/main/week1_quarter.tar.gz # use the tar command to uncompress the file. This will also automatically make a week1 folder tar -xzvf week1_quarter.tar.gz Now that we have something in our MarineGenomics directory we can use the ls command a bit more. … Let’s go into the Week1 directory and see what is in there. $ cd Week1 $ ls -F SRR6805880_1.fastq SRR6805880_2.fastq This directory contains two files with .fastq extensions. FASTQ is a format for storing information about sequencing reads and their quality. We will be learning more about FASTQ files in a later lesson. From this output, we can see that .. did indeed take us back one level in our file system. You can chain these together like so: $ ls ../../ prints the contents of /home. Let’s explore a few more properties of the ls function Go back to your home directory. $ cd Let’s look at some of the options for the ls function using the man command (note this will print out several lines of text) $ man ls The -a option is short for all and says that it causes ls to “not ignore entries starting with .” This is the option we want. $ ls -a . .ICEauthority .Rhistory .ansible .bash_logout .cache .dbus .fontconfig .local .r .ssh .wget-hsts Desktop Downloads Pictures Templates .. .Renviron .Xauthority .bash_history .bashrc .config .emacs.d .gnupg .profile .rstudio-desktop .vnc .xsession-errors Documents Music Public Videos You’ll see there are many more files shown now that we can look at the hidden ones. In most commands the flags can be combined together in no particular order to obtain the desired results/output. $ ls -Fa $ ls -laF 3.3 Examining the contents of other directories By default, the ls commands lists the contents of the working directory (i.e. the directory you are in). You can always find the directory you are in using the pwd command. However, you can also give ls the names of other directories to view. Navigate to your home directory if you are not already there. $ cd Then enter the command: $ ls MarineGenomics data This will list the contents of the MarineGenomics directory without you needing to navigate there. The cd command works in a similar way. Try entering: $ cd $ cd MarineGenomics/data This will take you to the MarineGenomics directory without having to go through the intermediate directory. Navigating practice Navigate to your home directory. From there, list the contents of the Week1 directory. $ cd $ ls MarineGenomics/data/Week1 SRR6805880_1.fastq SRR6805880_2.fastq 3.4 Key Points The /, ~, and .. characters represent important navigational shortcuts. Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a -. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
